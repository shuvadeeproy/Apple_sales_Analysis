This project focuses on analyzing Apple’s sales data using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The main objective is to uncover key business insights, identify sales patterns, and visualize performance trends across products, regions, and time periods.
The analysis begins by importing and cleaning the dataset using Pandas, ensuring the data is structured, consistent, and ready for exploration. Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed to understand overall sales distribution, customer behavior, and product demand.
Data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create clear and interactive charts, including bar plots, line graphs, heatmaps, and product comparison visuals. These charts help highlight trends like seasonal sales spikes, best-selling Apple products, revenue contributions, and regional performance differences.
Advanced analysis techniques—such as correlation analysis, time-series trend evaluation, and category-wise segmentation—are applied to identify factors impacting sales. Finally, insights from the analysis can support decision-making for product marketing, pricing, and inventory planning.
This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, visualization, problem-solving, and analytical thinking using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
